# Galactus Web
Galactus web is the web frontend for the galactus service. It uses a microservice architecture to manage rooms, sync videos, and
keep track of videos in a queue.
The Galactus web interface uses [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for the frontend, and client code is generated using
[OpenAPI](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) specs that are written for two services, [queueservice](https://github.com/galactus-player/queueservice) and [roomservice](https://github.com/galactus-player/roomservice).

## Galactus layout
There are two main pages, one is the room page and the other is the index page.
The index page shows a button to create a new room and a text field for inputting a room code.
New rooms are generated by calls to the roomservice API.

When the user clicks the "Play or Queue" button, they are brought to the queue interface, where they can add and remove videos to
the watching queue.

Once the user is in a room, a video can be played after adding it to the queue.
These operations are done through calls to the queueservice API.

# Running Galactus in Docker
In order to run galactus, you need Docker and docker-compose. 
To start up the entire service, run:
```
docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml up
```
Then, the service should be available at `localhost:80`.
